Striving for succinct solutions in Haskell.
Since the problems are deterministic mappings they should require no state; all solutions will therefore be pure transformations.

The vast majority of the solutions will operate on standard in/out.
The standard way of executing the solutions are:
```bash
cat input.txt | ./dayXpY
```
